#### Documentation
> The Documentation is using the OpenAPI Standard, which can be read by tools like Swagger, in this case I am using [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio). Which makes documentation reading, writing and API testing easier.

The documentation can be found in "pavemind-express/doc" folder, if Spotlight opens doc folder it will load all the OpenAPI configurations.
